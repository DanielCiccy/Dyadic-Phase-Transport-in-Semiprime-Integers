# Dyadic-Phase-Transport-in-Semiprime-Integers
Empirical study of 500K 64-bit semiprimes n=pq revealing a non-local angular structure in integer multiplication. Phases θn align with θp+θq ​ (mean error: 0.16 rad), modulated by dyadic carry and factor imbalance. A geometric, data-driven law for phase transport—no analytic assumptions.
